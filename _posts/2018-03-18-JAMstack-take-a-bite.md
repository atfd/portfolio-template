## Jamstack: take a bite.

What's in the stack? 

JavaScript, APIs, and markup.

Client-side JavaScript (this can be vanilla JavaScript, a library like Vue.js, or a front-end framework like React)
Server side processes and database commands are implemented via API, and accessed by JS-driven HTTP calls. 
Markup: build tools and static site generators.
